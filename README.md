This notebook shows changes in extreme precipitation under the <b> IPCC RCP8.5 scenario </b>, as predicted by a 3-ensemble, high-resolution CESM simulation [1] with nominal ocean and atmosphere resolutions of 0.1 deg and 27 km, respectively. These calculations are motivated by an earlier study analyzing changes in extreme precipitation under climate change using coarse-resolution GCM output [2].
